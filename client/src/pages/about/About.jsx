                        <p>Hi ! My name is <span>Alexander Ksairi</span>, 28 years old and I come from Syria, Damascus! My journey in IT began since I set up my Facebook account. I was amazed at its functionality and how everything works, from setting up profiles to sharing thoughts with others. Incredible! After leaving my country in 2015 and starting a new life in Germany, learning its language and culture, I started studying computer science at the University of Leipzig. Unfortunately, things didn't go well for me. But I am known as a person who does not give up. After a short time of restarting with an apprenticeship 2020 in order to fulfil my dream of becoming a web developer, I ended up at the Digital Career Institute in Hamburg (DCI), where I developed my knowledge of various programming languages starting from frontend such as HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript including Bootstrap and Node-Sass, and continued with backend (MERN). People say that I have great design skills that allow me to pay attention to small details and make my projects even more attractive by keeping my work clean, structured and readable. I'm very passionate and dedicated to my work.</p>
